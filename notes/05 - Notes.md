# Information Architecture

## Organizing Content and Flow

<br />

*"Information Architecture"* - Louis Rosenfeld & Peter Morville

- Four Components
    1. Organizational Structure
    2. Labeling Systems
    3. Navigation Systems
    4. Search Systems

<br />

## What is Information Architecture

*IA means consciously organizing the **content and flow** of a website, app, or system*.

- IA is based on:
    - How content will be organized
    - What content will be called (labeling)
    - What and how much they expect to find
    - How they expect to be able to move through it
    - How they expect to be able to **view, enter, download, manipulate,** or **interact** with it.

**IA isn't just relegated to webistes and apps.**
- ie: in a store, looking for a department that has what you need in it.

### IA vs. Site Map:
- The **IA** is a **Strategy** for categorizing, organizing, prioritizing, and linking content, based on user expectations/ needs and business goals.
- The **Site map** is a **visual representation** that illustrates this strategy.
    - *The site map shows navigation and main content areas, along with the relationships between pages on the site.*

<br />

## Content Strategy: Identifying, Organizing, and Delivering

**Content should be strategic**
- Conent should be leveraged strategically to serve a goal. - To deliver a specific meassage to end users, ie: to make the *feel* a certain way.
- To provide something they con't get anywhere else, or at least not in this way.
- There are certain considerations that determine what kinds of content should be included on your website.

<br />

**The content you or your client chooses has to be three things:**
1. Relevant
2. Appropriate
3. Useful

<br />

### Content should be relevant
- Is it relevant to our **reason for existing**?
- Is it relevant to the reason poeple came to the site
- are they going to identify with it
- Will it encourage them to take the intended action (ie: join, share, buy, download...)

### Content should be appropriate
- Is it consistent with the **message** that we're putting out everywhere else?
- Is it consistent in terms of **theme and tone** of voice?
- Is the **style** appropriate both for the business and the audience?
- Is it telling the **truth**?

### Content should be useful
- Is it **useful**, **valuable**, and/or **meaningful** to the consumer?
- Is it **happy talk**? (Bull shit)
- Is it about you or **them**?
- Is the content answering: **"What's in it for me"**?

## Determining Content Requirements

- Who's going to **create** the content?
- Who's going to **edit** and **approve** it?
- Who's going to **manage** and **update** the content?
- What are **competitors** doing?
- Will people thinkg the content is **useful** and **valuable**?
- How will people **find** the content?
- How many **different kinds** of content will there be (ie: audio, text, etc...)
- Where does this **fit** in our established IA?
- How will we **display** all the content? (including playing, animations, volume, etc)
- Are there **form factor** restrictions? (ie: phones vs. desktops)

## Exercise: Identifying Content Workflows

1. Talk to content stakeholders
    - Identify everyone associated with **creating, editing, approving,** or **requesting content**.
        - You ask questions, they answer. Diagram and ask additional questions as the conversation takes place.
        - Ask them to describe their **current process** for **creating** and publishing content.
        - Ask them what's **working** and what is not working
        - Ask them which people (in what roles) are involved in content **creation**, **editing**, and **approval**
    - Diagram what you learn about their **roles**, **tasks**, and **relationships**
    
    <br />

    <br />
    
    <br />

2. Define Tasks and Activities expected of the content creators
    - Adding text, photos, videos, social feeds, etc...
    - Creating new pages
    - Deleting pages and assets
    - Adding or updating metadata
    - Publishing content to a test server
    - Returning new or edited content with comments for revisions
    - Scheduling content for publication
    - Etc...

<br />

3. Diagram the process (the content creation process)

<br />

![Talking To Content Stakeholders 2](./images/05%20-%20Notes%20-%20TalkingToContentStakeholders2.png)

<br />

<br />

4. Ask questions as you diagram

    - Can authors create new pages or just edit existing?
    - Who is authorized to create a subfolder?
    - Can authors delete pages? What about other related assets on pages?
    - Can editors approve content across the entire site or only specific sections?
    - What about content *they own* that spreads across multiple sections of the site?
    - How do we manage multiple approvers (editors)?
    - How do we manage workflow when multiple authors are working on the same page?
    - Are content managers involved in the workflow process? Are they informed about publishing updates? Are they responsible for documenting changes in the system somewhere?

## Information Architecture Tips:
<br />

1. Identify content and socialize IA **Early**
    - *Every **content** idea **sounds great** when **someone else is responsible for creating it***

2. Proceed with Caution (when talking about content creation)
    - At least half of the content discussed doesn't sound so good when it's all on a persons shoulders to create.
    - If design or development proceeds without a clear IA, you open the door for surprises later.
    - If you have to redesign, re-architect, and rebuild, you will *not* get any **additional time or money** for your efforts
    - **GET CONTENT MODEL APPROVED BEFORE BEGINNING DEVELOPMENT**

3. Start with context of use
    - The external factors that influence how people interact with your content, navigation, and information structures.

<br/>

### 5 States affect context
- Physical
- Environmental
- Preferential
- Emotional
- Cognitive

#### Physical
- Are they using a mobile device?
- Both hands or one hand?
- Left or right hand?
- Are they standing still or walking while using software?

#### Environmental
- What room could they be in?
- Is it noisy, crowded?
- Are they on the couch with a tablet?

#### Preferential
- How would they prefer to access content?
- On what device?
- Do they prefer video/audio instead of text?
- Are there learning disabilities to be considered?

#### Emotional
- How stressed are the users likely to be?
- What is motivating their activity?
- What do they want from us?
- What can a user not live without?
- Is there a consequence for not giving a user what they want?

#### Cognitive
- What assumptions will they make based on interacting with content?
- What's their ability to learn?
- Is it suitable for all education or skill levels?
- Are we talking to a narrow, well-defined group of people - or is this a mass market product with varying degrees of literacy, education, etc...

## IA must be **user-centered**
*Its purpose, strategy, form, and function should all revolve around **user expectation***

### The wrong way:
- Design an IA or site map that essentially mirrors the company's organization chart
- Uses the company's internal mental models and vocabulary
- Reflects what the company wants people to do instead of what people really want to do
- Reflects the language and terms the company uses (acronyms)

### The right way:
- Design the IA or site map to reflect **prioritized user needs**
- 85% of customers are buying 15% of your products
    - List those product first!
- What a customer calls a product is more important than what a company calls it.
    - ie: **customer** *calls it a "screen door"* - **Company** *calls it a "netted door"*

## Creating and Prioritizing IA - **Creating an IA Model**

Addressing two things:
1. **Content Labeling** & taxonomy
2. **File Naming** & taxonomy

<br />

### **Content Labeling**

- Good labeling helps people **predict what they'll get** before they click or tap
- The closer a label is to what a **user would call it** (descriptive), the higher change they'll interact with it.
- As a user, clicking on a link that isn't where you wanted to go, can be very exhausting.
- Companies will often default to industry terminology - Users often won't know what those labels mean...

*Questions to ask:*
- Is that what your customers would call it?
- What category would users expect to find this label in?
- What's the action a user is taking when they click this button?

#### **Choosing useful labels**
- Choose clear, descriptive words and phrases
    - Strive to be *Boring*
- Don't make up words or terms - Stick to commonly used terms
- Don't overlap categories
- **Make sure your organizational scheme makes sense to users** (No model numbers - names or descriptions are better).
- **Don't rely on your own opinions** - TEST!

<br />

### **File Naming**

- Consistency between your IA and your File Structure gives you and your team a map for where everything goes
- File and directory naming should follow the same scheme as your category names
- **File names should match IA category labels**

    ![05 - Notes - FileNaming](./images/05%20-%20Notes%20-%20FileNaming.png)

<br />

**Example (Bookstore)**
- If a part of the IA looks like:
    ```
    Products -> Books -> Biographies -> New Releases
    ```
- The file structure (as URL) would look like:
    ```
    www.websitename.com/products/books/biographies/2015/new-releases.html
    ```

- The same goes for **Images**
    - ie: file structure (as url):
    ```
    ... .com/products/books/biographies/2015/new-releases.html
    ```
    - Images route:
    ```
    ... /images/products/books/biographies/2015/book-title-author-cover.jpg
    ```

### **Grouping and Classifying Content**

*Common content classification methods:*

- Chronological
    - Appropriate for time-based content
- Alphabetical
    - Great when users need to find something fast
    - Incl. definitions, indexes, etc...
- Geographical
    - Use when content is specifically related to a physical place 
    - ie: country, city, building, layout, etc...
- Most Popular
    - Great for interest-based browsing, rather than users need
- Process Order
    - When content represents a process, organize it according to the order of actions a user should take
    - ie: "How to optimize a hard drive..."
