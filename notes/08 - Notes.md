# Wireframing

<br />

### Wireframes represent:
- Information priority and organization of onscreen elements
- Labeling and Categorization across pages and content
- Basic layout and organization of each page
- How the various wayfinding mechanisms (menus, links, search, etc...) work
- How people will interact with what's being presented, and how the site responds

<br />

## What a Wireframe Is **Not**:

- An actual UI design
    - Wireframes show how a site works, not how it will look (no images, colors or fonts)
- A guess at content
    - Whenever possible, use real text for client approval
    - No Lorem Ipsum
- A drawing
    - It may be visual, but the work being done here is *thinking*
- A "Quick Sketch"
    - Every element of every page has to be labeled and described.

<br />

### Takeaway: **Talk to developers Before you wireframe**
- Socialize sketches to test the feasibility of your intended interactions, features and functionality.

## What a Wireframe **IS**:

*A blueprint for the design and development*

- It connects IA to visual design and **validates** the strength of the user experience
    - **Structure**: How will the site be built?
    - **Content**: What will be displayed?
    - **Information** hierarchy: How is this information organized and displayed?
    - **Functionality**: How will this work?
    - **Behavior**: How do users interact with it?

### Who uses wireframes?
- UX Designers and Information Architects use wireframes to design user flows
- UI Designers use wireframes to think through and show the visual hierarchy of onscreen elements
- Developers use wireframes to get a clear idea of the site's intended functionality
- Clients and Project/Product Managers use wireframes to gain a clear understanding of the site as a whole.

## Tips for Successful Wireframing

1. Start with Sketches
    - Don't start with software - It will influence and constrain your decisions
    - Get dow **several** quick ideas of what these screens could look like
    - **Don't stop to judge or analyze** - Just Go
    - As soon as it feels like you're **overworking** it, move on
        - **Two minutes max**
    - **Do as many as you possibly can** (20 - 25)
        - Reevaluate them later

2. Keep the UI Generic
    - **All fonts are Arial**
        - Use bold and italics to differentiate headlines from content.
    - **All elements are shades of grey or solid black**
        - Darker shades indicate higher visual priority, lighter shades indicate lower
    - **Use Blue to call out text hyperlinks**
        - Allows you and client to quickly tell where these are and test them
    - **No images**
        - Indicate these with empty boxes withe the label [IMAGE] in the center

3. Use Real Layout Specs
    - This is the time to be thinking about what fits onscreen at **various resolutions**
    - **Decide on a grid** for responsive design
        - Start with that structure and lit it inform future layout decisions
    - Use **real content** if possible, so you know exactly what fits in a given space
    - **Design the structure** - not look and feel - of the layout to the **highest degree of accuracy possible**

4. Use Real Labels and Text
    - You can't make strategic decisions about **how navigation works** or **how users consume content** if you don't know what any of it is or what it's called
    - You can't simulate a **registration** process if you don't know what data is collected.
    - You can't account for **rich media content** (videos) if you don't know it exists
    - You can't decide where to put a **call to action** if you don't know what it is

    ### **Without real content - every minute you spend wireframing is a minute wasted**

    <br />

5. Go Past the Happy Path
    - Design for the scenarios when something goes wrong

    ### Include and design error feedback in your wireframes that explain: **What happened, Why it happened, and What to do about it.**

## Wireframing - **Tools of the Trade**

- Three general categories to create wireframes
    - Paper and Pen
    - Presentation Software - ie: PowerPoint/Keynote
    - Wireframing Software - ie: Axure RP, UXPin, Justinmind, etc...

    ### The fastest, most efficient way to create functioning wireframe prototypes is with **Wireframing Software**
