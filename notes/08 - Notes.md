# Wireframing

<br />

### Wireframes represent:

- Information priority and organization of onscreen elements
- Labeling and Categorization across pages and content
- Basic layout and organization of each page
- How the various wayfinding mechanisms (menus, links, search, etc...) work
- How people will interact with what's being presented, and how the site responds

<br />

## What a Wireframe Is **Not**:

- An actual UI design
  - Wireframes show how a site works, not how it will look (no images, colors or fonts)
- A guess at content
  - Whenever possible, use real text for client approval
  - No Lorem Ipsum
- A drawing
  - It may be visual, but the work being done here is _thinking_
- A "Quick Sketch"
  - Every element of every page has to be labeled and described.

<br />

### Takeaway: **Talk to developers Before you wireframe**

- Socialize sketches to test the feasibility of your intended interactions, features and functionality.

## What a Wireframe **IS**:

_A blueprint for the design and development_

- It connects IA to visual design and **validates** the strength of the user experience
  - **Structure**: How will the site be built?
  - **Content**: What will be displayed?
  - **Information** hierarchy: How is this information organized and displayed?
  - **Functionality**: How will this work?
  - **Behavior**: How do users interact with it?

### Who uses wireframes?

- UX Designers and Information Architects use wireframes to design user flows
- UI Designers use wireframes to think through and show the visual hierarchy of onscreen elements
- Developers use wireframes to get a clear idea of the site's intended functionality
- Clients and Project/Product Managers use wireframes to gain a clear understanding of the site as a whole.

## Tips for Successful Wireframing

1. Start with Sketches

   - Don't start with software - It will influence and constrain your decisions
   - Get dow **several** quick ideas of what these screens could look like
   - **Don't stop to judge or analyze** - Just Go
   - As soon as it feels like you're **overworking** it, move on
     - **Two minutes max**
   - **Do as many as you possibly can** (20 - 25)
     - Reevaluate them later

2. Keep the UI Generic

   - **All fonts are Arial**
     - Use bold and italics to differentiate headlines from content.
   - **All elements are shades of grey or solid black**
     - Darker shades indicate higher visual priority, lighter shades indicate lower
   - **Use Blue to call out text hyperlinks**
     - Allows you and client to quickly tell where these are and test them
   - **No images**
     - Indicate these with empty boxes withe the label [IMAGE] in the center

3. Use Real Layout Specs

   - This is the time to be thinking about what fits onscreen at **various resolutions**
   - **Decide on a grid** for responsive design
     - Start with that structure and lit it inform future layout decisions
   - Use **real content** if possible, so you know exactly what fits in a given space
   - **Design the structure** - not look and feel - of the layout to the **highest degree of accuracy possible**

4. Use Real Labels and Text

   - You can't make strategic decisions about **how navigation works** or **how users consume content** if you don't know what any of it is or what it's called
   - You can't simulate a **registration** process if you don't know what data is collected.
   - You can't account for **rich media content** (videos) if you don't know it exists
   - You can't decide where to put a **call to action** if you don't know what it is

   ### **Without real content - every minute you spend wireframing is a minute wasted**

   <br />

5. Go Past the Happy Path

   - Design for the scenarios when something goes wrong

   ### Include and design error feedback in your wireframes that explain: **What happened, Why it happened, and What to do about it.**

## Wireframing - **Tools of the Trade**

- Three general categories to create wireframes

  - Paper and Pen
  - Presentation Software - ie: PowerPoint/Keynote
  - Wireframing Software - ie: Axure RP, UXPin, Justinmind, etc...

  ### The fastest, most efficient way to create functioning wireframe prototypes is with **Wireframing Software**

## Wireframing - **Socializing and Validating Wireframes**

### **Share the Prototype**

Once you've created a click-through prototype, the next step is to socialize it with three groups, in this order:

- **Design and Development team members**
- **Project Stakeholders, meaning your clients or partners**
  - Make sure they understand that anything not represented here is **not getting built**
- Prospective or Current Users
  - When possible, working prototypes should be shared with prospective users.
  - A group of your peers is a reasonable substitute for times when you can't test with actual uses

### **Get stakeholder approval**

- You want to make sure you get their (the customers) sign-off and approval on what they see, because:
  - It's the right thing to do
  - They will almost always think of new features later - You need to be able to point to what was agreed to!
- In this case, sign-off literally means a signed piece of paper that explains what they're agreeing to.

  #### **See Attachments Folder for a Signoff Template** 
  -  `.../attachments/Wireframe-Signoff-Template.docx`

### **Schedule a Review**

- The best way to socialize wireframes is via a **collaborative review session**
- When an in-person review is not possible, Email a link and give instructions as to:
    - What they're looking at
    - What is means
    - What you need from them in return
    #### **See Attachments Folder for a Email Wireframe Review Template** 
  -  `.../attachments/Wireframe Presentation Script.docx`

# Information Architecture - Things to Remember

- The content you or your client chooses has to be 
    - Relevant 
    - Appropriate
    - Useful

- Identify content and Socialize IA Early
    - Every piece of content sounds important when someone else is making it!

- Consider context of use
    - The external factors that influence how people interact with your content, navigation and information structures.

- IA Must be User-Centered
    - it's purpose, strategy, form and function should all revolve around the user

- File names should match IA Category Labels

- People start with a task, not a document
    - What is it they Value?

- Make the path(s) to value **Obvious and Clear** in your navigation

- Talk to developers before you wireframe
    - Socialize your sketches to evaluate feasability

- Without real content, **every minute you spend wireframing is a minute wasted**
    - Push for the real content from the client before wireframing

- Include and design error feedback in your wireframes that explain 
    - What happened 
    - Why it happened
    - What to do about it

- The fasted way to create wireframe prototypes wi with **Wireframing Software**
    - Something is always better than nothing though...
