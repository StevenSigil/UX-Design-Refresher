# Timeless UI Design Principles

## Affordance

- **Physical Characteristics** of an element suggest and influence how it's used. (ie: a doorknob is shaped as it is to form to the fingers)
- Onscreen, this is **purely visual** (ie: buttons and fields)
- It should be **inconceivable** that the design could function or be used any other way.
- Design individual elements - and the app or site as a whole - to **afford intended function** and **discourage improper use**.

_(think of the three dots on a re-sizable part of a Mac application - That insinuates that those three dots do something - ie: resize the pane)_

<br />

## Closure

When an object is **incomplete** - but enough of it is indicated - the mind perceives teh object to be whole by **mentally filling the information**.

- When adding something to a "cart" - in an online store - showing a message and/or changing the button from "add to cart" to "item added" **shows closure**

<br />

## Consistency

Usability is improved when similar parts are expressed in similar ways. Consistency in aesthetic style and appearance:

- Enhances **recognition**
- Communicates **membership**
- Sets emotional **expectation**
- Establishes and reinforces unique **identity**

**Functional:** leverages existing knowledge about how something works

**Consistency** in UI design provides:

- **Familiar** meaning and action
- Navigational **reference points**
- Simplified **usability**
- Increased **intuitive learning**

<br />

## Continuation

- Aligned elements are perceived as a **single group**, related to each other
- Alignment "extends" across **negative space** - strength of alignment is dependent on proximity
- Unrelated items have **different alignment paths** or disrupt an existing path
- Even organizing a bar chart from least to greatest is easier to read, due to **good continuation**

<br />

## Face-ism Ratio

- Ratio of **face-to-body** in an image influences the way the person in the image is perceived.
  - Face focuses attention on **intellectual** and **personality** attributes
  - Body focuses attention on **physical** and **sensual** attributes

_Be aware of the **amount of Face** compared to the **amount of Body** shown on your website_

<br />

## Enclosure

Things that appear to have a boundary around them are perceived to be **grouped** - and therefore **related**

_(Think of a nav-bar split into three parts with some links on the left, some on the right, and the logo in the middle)_

<br />

## Figure-Ground Relationship

- **Figure:** definite shape, close
- **Ground:** shapeless, far
- Stable relationship focuses **attention**
- Minimizes perceptual **confusion**
- Increases **recognition** of key elements
- **Ambiguous relationships make bad communication design!**
- ie: Think of the Vans website - when you click on a shoe, a Modal opens...

  - **Transparent, darker background de-emphasizes** existing content
  - **Contrast** between modal window color and darker transparent background
  - Manipulating the **figure-ground relationship** makes this workflow clear

- Deiter Rams' **final principle** for good design states: "...as little design as possible"
- What's the **least amount of detail** that can be aded to create the necessary impact?
- Applying Gestalt principles - like figure-ground - creates focus on the **essential meaning** in your UI.

<br />

## Similarity

- Similar objects are perceived to be part of a **group** or **pattern**
- Pinterest **entries** are all visually similar.
- **Interaction patterns** for each entry are also similar

- Apple's App Store uses similarity to visually group and identify **product types**
  - At a quick glance, it's easy to tell **navigation tools** from **ads** from the **apps** themselves\*\*

<br />

## Fitt's Law

**The time required to move to a target area** (eg: tap or click a button) is a function of:

- **distance** to the target
- **Size** of the target
  - (think of Apple's "Reachability" feature - double touching home button slides the screen down)

<br />

## Occam's Razor

- The **simplest** solution is usually the **best** solution:
  - Minimize **cognitive effort**
  - **Recognition** over recall
  - Make things look like what they are in **real life** (skeuomorphism)
- If you take this principle one step further, you kep the visual metaphor, but **simplify visual presentation**.

  - ie: create **flat design**

- Clues, not clutter:
  - **Perceived affordance** tells user that action is possible.
    - ie: Sliding Buttons and Safari's Tabs
  - Forget about flat vs. skeuomorphic; focus on **clues vs. clutter!**

<br />

## Hicks' Law

- In the era of infinite choice, people need **better filters**.
- Every additional choice **increases the time required** to make a decision
- At the point when a person is **confident** in a decision, he stops **seeking choices**.
- People don't read online
- **Titles + Images + Text** make dense content easier to decipher
- The combination of **design patterns** (alignment, enclosure, etc...) and **image thumbnails** allows us to parse a lot of content on Pinterest.
  - Take away the **images**, and parsing becomes MUCH harder.

<br />

## Depth of Processing

- Information analyzed **deeply** is better recalled than information that is analyzed **superficially**

  - **Maintenance rehearsal:** repeating existing or previous analysis
    - ie: repeating a phone number back to yourself to help you remember
  - **Elaborative Rehearsal:** deeper, more meaningful analysis
    - ie: reading a text passage and then answering questions about its meaning.
    - Recall is 2-3 times better and more accurate with **Elaborative Rehearsal**

- Depth of Processing is improved through:
  - Use of **multiple presentation media**.
    - eg: video combined with captions
  - Activities that engage users in **elaborative rehearsal**
    - ed: interactive Q&A, first person role playing, etc...

<br />

## Forgiveness

- UI design should help people **avoid errors** and **minimize negative consequences** via:
  - **Confirmation**
    - Require verification of intent, or confirm prior action/task completion.
  - **Help**
    - Assistance with basic operations, troubleshooting, and error recovery
  - **Reversibility**
    - Allow one or more actions to be reversed if an error occurs or intent changes.
  - **Warnings**
    - Communicate consequences of actions - even better if it's specific
  - **Caveat:** _too many_ confirmations or warnings increase the likelihood they'll be ignored

<br />

## Garbage In - Garbage Out

*The quality of **system output** equals the quality of **data input***

There are two types of problems:

- **Type:** Wrong type of input is entered.
  - ie: entering a phone number in a credit card number field
- **Quality:** Correct type of input is entered with defects
  - ie: entering the wrong phone number or adding an extra digit


<br />

## Signal-to-Noise Ratio

This is the ratio of **relevant** info (signal) to **irrelevant** info (noise) in the UI.
- Noise **reduces clarity** by diluting useful information with useless information
- Minimize noise by **removing unnecessary elements**, and **minimizing** or simplifying representation of **necessary** elements


<br />

## Progressive Disclosure

*The most **important design element***

Only **necessary** or **requested** information is displayed at any given time.
- Information presented to a person who isn't **interested** or **ready to process it** is noise.
- Crucial question: What's required to take the **very next step**?
- Helps people manage **complexity** without becoming confused, frustrated, or disoriented

UI Design is a constant balancing act between **Simplicity & Completeness**
- Initially show **only the most important** options.
- Prioritize according to **user needs & business goals**
- Offer a larger set of specialized options **on request**; disclose additional features/info only if the **user asks for them** (or needs them)
