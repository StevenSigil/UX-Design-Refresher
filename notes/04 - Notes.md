# Planning for Front-End *User Testing*

*What we're testing (and what we're not)*

### Why plan testing now?

- **You get additional clarity on scope.**
  - Knowing which browsers and devices you'll test for helps you focus and saves time.
- **Less explaining (and argument) later with the client.**
  - Setting expectations now for what you'll test reduces misunderstanding later.
- **Less stress before, during, and after launch.**
  - If you've thoroughly tested everything, you can be confident everything displays an performs as expected.

<br />

### You can't test everything.
- Budgets are finite.
  - if you're working for a client, you're working with a budget.
- Schedules are finite.
  - If testing isn't on the schedule, it'll be rushed or left out.
- Not every scenario matters.
  - Your website may not need ot work on *EVERY* device.

## Creating a Test Plan

1. **Who are we testing for?**

    - Focus on the scenarios most relevant to your audience:
      - What are the most popular devices they'll use?
      - What OS/browser combinations are most popular among your audience?
      - What connection speeds do they have?
      - How tech-savvy is your demographic?
    - **Use statistical information to identify demographics**
      - W3 Schools (http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/default.asp)
      - Net Market Share (http://www.netmarketshare.com)
      - StatCounter (http://gs.statcounter.com)

2. **Prioritize Browser & Device Support**

    - Separate testing priorities into categories like below:
