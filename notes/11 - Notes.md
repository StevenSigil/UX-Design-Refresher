# Design: Information, Interaction and Interface - Pt. 2

## Tips for Solving Visual Problems

*Identify the right problems to solve*

### 1. Don't look for inspiration
- You will not find inspiration looking at the work of other designers
    - You *will* find someone else's solution to someone else's problem.
- Focus design efforts on **your** problem, your **client's** problem, your **user's** problems

*"Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the wise. __Seek what they sought__"* - Matsuo Basho

<br />

### 2. "Different" should always equal "Better"
- Differences can draw attention, but they can also **cause distraction**.
    - The goal is to have the **User Focus** on the **Content**, **not** the **interface**
- **Flat Design** has become a widespread trend.
    - Designers are adopting the **look** without considering whether it's **appropriate** for the situation or whether people will **understand** what they see.
    - Flat design without **visual affordance** makes it difficult for the user to understand that what they're seeing is interactive.
    - *A button should look like a button*

    ### *"Don't be different just to be different. Be different when it makes something better."* - David Hogue

<br />

### 3. Design the parts to be consistent with the whole

- Consistency between the parts (websites) and the whole (internet) creates ease of use.
    - ie: the Save/Cancel pattern in a dialog box - It is an expected way of interacting.

<br />

### 4. Conventions can be your friends
- Use the established guidelines for the devices your are building an application for.

<br />

### 5. Leverage design patterns
- Design patterns are optimal solutions to common design problems.
    - Problems can be shared and **resolved** by a community of people, lessening a developer's burden
    - As a result, **common solutions emerge**
    - The best of these solutions become widely implemented, then become the standard way of doing whatever was teh issue.
- Implementing an established design pattern:
    - Reduces the risk of users rejecting a site or app because of unfamiliar choices
    - Reduces the **time** and **cost** necessary to carry out specific tasks.
    - Avoids wasted time **reinventing the wheel**
    - Provides a **familiar**, **comfortable** and **recognizable** experience for people

<br />

### 6. Beware of False Patterns

Beware of design pattern libraries with **no explanations** of what, how and why.
- These collections don't say anything about what problems they were created to solve
- We will then have no idea **how decisions were made**

<br />

### 7. **Do** use these patterns

- **UI Patterns**

<br />

### 8. **Ask these questions** (to determine a design pattern to use):
*There are **several things you need to consider** in order to determine what existing design patterns will solve your particular design problem:*

- What **user problem** are you solving?
- How have **other designers or developers** solved this problem?
- Can I **share an example** with stakeholders or prospective users?
- **When** should this pattern be used?

# Organizing Visual Information

## Organizing, Economizing, and Communicating

<br />

### **Good UI Design has 3 jobs:**
- It has to **organize**, providing the user with a clear and consistent conceptual structure
- It has to **economize**, doing the most with the least amount of cues
- It has to **communicate**, matching the presentation to the expectations and capabilities of the user

### **Organizing visual elements**

- **Clear visual hierarchy** explains relationships between elements on the screen and tells the visitor what's most important
- That enables **consistency**, some clarity that demarcates different elements
- Hierarchy also **clarifies relationships**, telling the visitor if or how elements are related.
- Finally, the more effort you spend organizing elements, the easier it is for someone to **navigate** through all of them.
    ### Major UI improvements can come from **re-aligning and re-prioritizing elements**.

<br />

### **Economizing visual elements**

- Only show elements **critical to communication**
- What's included must be **immediately relevant** to the task at hand
- Visually **emphasize** critical elements and actions
- **De-emphasize** non-critical elements and actions

<br />

### **Communicating with visual elements**
- Clear communication in your UI is a deft balance of:
    - Legibility
    - Readability
    - Typography
    - Symbolism
    - Multiple views
    - Color and/or texture

<br />

### **Design is NOT Decoration**

- Visual design should never be based on **personal preference** or on what **""looks cool"**
- Ask yourself, does my UI Design:
    - Support established **objectives**?
    - Clarify the **options** available?
    - Provide **context** and **guidence**?
    - Establish clear **information** and/or **action priority**?

<br />

## **Four Key Organizing Principles**

- Alignment
- Proximity
- Repetition
- Contrast

*When a design is not working, it means that one of these four things is either **missing** or **misapplied**.*

<br />

### **Alignment**

**Don't center align text** - *Unless it's a button or one-word label*

- Alignment provides **cognitive stability**
- Alignment creates **visual relationships**
- **Every element** in the UI should be aligned with one or more other elements

<br />

### **Proximity**

- Elements visually **close** to each other are perceived as a single group, related by **context of use**.
- Unrelated items are **visually separated**

<br />

- Negative space enables **focus**
- Negative space is NOT 'blank' space - it's **purposeful**

    ### **Use negative space purposefully.** Give it as much attention - if not *more* - than all other UI elements.

<br />

### **Repetition**

- Create a **hierarchy of visual styles** - fonts, colors, textures, graphical elements.
- **Re-use** elements of those visual styles, both in corresponding styles and in visual elements
- Established **design patterns** are specific, recognizable, patterns that people **know** and **expect**
- **Purposeful repetition ensure visual consistency**

<br />

### **Contrast**

- Use contrast to focus attention
- Areas of highest **contrast** draw viewer attention
- Contrast should be applied according to the **importance** of a particular element
- **Primary content** or **actions** should have the most contrast.
- Contrast doesn't have to mean **harshness**
- Pronounced lack of color and exaggerated negative space allows **focus** on items of interest
- This decreases the reader's **sense of urgency**, inviting them to take their time
    ### **Contrast creates information hierarchy** - consider contrast before color
