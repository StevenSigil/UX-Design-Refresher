## Turning Information Priority into an IA Model

<br />

- Determining **Content Priority** - **Client** vs. **User Ranking**

- **IA Specification Model**
    - Using the User-ranked priorities to model how content will be organizationally prioritized

## **IA Models**: Which one is right for my site?

- The **appropriateness** of the IA model determines whether a model is right for you or not.
- Right now, **navigation is sacrificed for content** (to pander to the *mobile first* mentality)
    - THIS IS A BAD THING FOR MANY PURPOSES

### Hierarchical Tree IA Model
- Standard for content-heavy websites
- Starts from simple and broad and drills down to specific content (pages)
- Provides multiple routes for users to explore
- Can become **link-heavy** and hard to accommodate on smaller screens

<br />

### Nested List IA Model
- Incrimental Menus
- Users tap or swipe to reveal additional menues
- Help people focus on content within individual sections
- Great for small screens but difficult to browse (generally)

<br />

### Hub and Spoke IA Model
- Central screen (hub) acts as **launchpad**
- Links point outward to other sections, each **seperate** from the others
- Eliminates the need for global navigation on each screen
- Best for **task-based** sites and apps

<br />

### Bento Box IA Model
- Dashboard-style app; pulls in dynamic components and information
- Most interactions occur in the context of a **single, multi-purpose** screen.
- Useful when users need data aggregated from **multiple sources**.

<br />

### Filtered View IA Model
- Deals with a **single data set**
- Information can be explored from **multiple views**
- Variety of user-controlled **views and sorting options**

## Tools for Creating IA Models

- An IA is really just an **Outline** - Any word processing software is fine
    - ie: Microshaft **Word**
    - Small websites don't need much more than 1-2 pages created in Word
    - However, **larger sites** can be difficult to visualize with this type of format

<br />

- **Visio, OmniGraffle, or XMind**
    - All three create visual diagrams - boxes and connectors that show **content hierarchy** and **relationships**
    - For mid-size to large enterprise or e-commerce websites
    - Easier for people to consume a **visual diagram** (instead of a novel-length text outline)

## Socializing and Validating Your IA Model

<br />

### **Tree testing**
1. Model the site structure on index cards
    - Create an index card for each level of categorization (ie: a tree)
    - The **top categories** are the main limbs of the tree, and the **subcategories** and **items** are the branches
    - EX: The first car would contain **7 categories**
        ```
        Clothing
        Electronics
        Gaming
        Jewelry
        Music
        Sports
        Toys + Hobbies
        ```

    - **THEN** Create a subsequent card containing **subcategories** for **each one** of those top level categories
    - You then do the same for any additional subcategories, until you've accounted for **every category, subcategory and item** in you proposed IA
    - EX: The **Clothing** category (above) would contain:
        ```
        Boys
        Girls
        Kids Unisex
        Men
        Women
        ```

2. Give participants many "Find It" scenarios
    - EX: **"Your 9-year-old son asks for a new belt with a cowboy buckle"**
    - Show them the **Top level card**
    - Ask them to **navigate** through the index cards until they find what they're looking for.
    - The participant chooses a topic from that card, leading to **another card** with subtopics
    - The Participant continues choosing topics, moving down the tree, **until they find their answer**
    - They can go back or up more level if needed
    - If they still can't find what hey were looking for, the give up and go to the next task

3. **You record activity during the session**
    - The **path the user takes** through the tree (using the reference numbers on the cards)
    - Whether or not the participant **found the correct topic**
    - Where the participant **hesitated** or **backtracked**

#### **Benefits of tree testing**
- By choosing a small number of representative tasks, you can quickly determine **which parts of the tree make sense to users** (and which don't)
- By **isolating the sit structure** - removing distractions of layout, design, and code - you can clearly **see how the IA itself performs** (and revise until you have a solid structure)
- Tree testing is the **fastest**, **most reliable** and **least expensive** way to quickly figure out if there is anything in an **existing IA** that's **worth salvaging**.
