# Definition: Planning for success (pt. 2)

<br />

## The UX Value Loop

- **User** perceives value
- They act and receive **proof** of that value
- If that cycle continues, they begin to **trust** the site
- When trust occurs, they **join**, **share**, or **purchase**
- That action **delivers ROI** to the sites creator

# Business Stakeholder Research

- Business Objectives - **Making** or **Saving** ***$$$***
- How do they **define success**?
- How will they **Measure** it (success)?
- Who is their **Competition**?

<br/>

## Identifying Business Goals: **Stakeholders**
---

- Stakeholders carry the most **responsibility** and **risk** for the website's success; they are your first source for defining what success truly *means*.
- Start **every** project by identifying **WHO** the key stakeholders are.

### **What is success?**
*You're looking for measurable goals and desired outcomes*:
- What needs to happen once we launch (or re-launch) this product and people **use** it?
- How does each stakeholder **answer** that question?
- How will each stakeholder (and their department) **measure** that success?

### **Why are we doing this?**
- Will the blog help **increase awareness** of my client's expertise, work or services?
- Will monetizing the site with ads offset production cost and **provide income**?
- Will the new features and functions **convince people to purchase**?
- Will a better website **prevent customers from switching** to a competitor?

### **Questions to ask:**
- **Who** are your customers or users?
- Why will people **visit/use/buy** from you?
- What should the website **accomplish**?
- How will you **measure** success?
- How does this website fit into your **overall business strategy**?
- What **technology** is in place, or what decisions have already been made?

## Analyzing the industry
---

*Every industry comes with a set of **regulations**, **preconceptions**, and **expectations**.*

- Common or best practices
- Competitive requirements
- Industry regulations (e.g. Governmental, Healthcare, etc...)

**Not knowing these practices or regulations before starting design can *Delay Launch* or cost a great deal to fix post-launch.**

<br />

*Every industry comes with a host of topics, areas, and issues that must be considered.*
- Specific terminology or language
- Tone of voice and design
- Business or service processes
- Brand positioning considerations
- Ratio of "show" (images, animation, etc...) to "tell" (data, facts, figures, etc...)

<br/>

## Analyzing the competition
---

*Every website has competition. Every client has competition of two kinds:*
- Direct competitors
  - Offer the exact same set of products and services your client (or your business) does.
- Indirect competitors
  - Offer some of what your client or company offers - but there may be other offerings they have that you don't, or vice versa.

<br />

*The most important questions to ask:*
- Who are your **top 5 competitors**?
- What are thr **primary differences** between your business model and theirs?
- **Why** do people visit a competitor's site, or use their product/service instead of yours?
- How will you position and **differentiate** yourself from the competition?

<br />

### ***PRO TIP***
If you *ever* hear the words "*We have no competition*"... **LEAVE THE ROOM AND DON'T GO BACK!!!!**

# User Research: *Putting People First*
- What they **Expect** to do
- Why that **Matters** to them
- What **Other Goals** they may have
- What **Other Tools** they use

<br />

## Identifying User Needs
---

*There are two general groups of websites/apps/software users:*
- Business-to-Business (B2B)
  - Users are visiting the site to conduct or support business activities
- Business-to-Consumer (B2C)
  - Users are visiting to be entertained, informed or to purchase products

<br />

### Interviewing B2B Users
- **Focus on the process** - and the issues they encounter.
- **Don't** ask about specific hardware, software, or even websites they use.
  - That question focuses on the tool they're using, instead of the **process** they go through.

```
Perceive a Need => Identify Options => Narrow Choices => Choose One
```

*Questions to Ask (B2B):*
- What constitutes a **good workday** for you?
- How do you go about doing (name a **specific process, task,** or **end goal**)?
- How does this process compare to **other organizations** you've worked for?
- What are the biggest **problems, obstacles** or **inefficiencies** you deal with in this process?
- Can you tell me about any/all **other systems, websites** or **apps** you use during the day?

<br />

### Interviewing B2C Users
*Like B2B, questions should be **open-ended**; don't "lead" the interviewee. **Stay big and simple***

- Don't solve problems.
- Don't suggest solutions.
- Don't give advice.

Patience is extremely important here; let the **silence** following the question do the heavy lifting - and repress the urge to fill it with your own voice.

<br />

*Questions to Ask (B2C):*

- if this is a new site, start by setting **context**
  - ie: "We're designing an e-commerce website that sells shoes."
- What task would you **put off** as long as you possibly can on a site like this?
- What things **frustrate** you the most?
- How **often** do you visit or use websites like this?
- **What** do you use them for most often?
  - Can you **show me** how you do that?
  - What **other things** do you do before, during or after you use this website?
  - Is there a website that does **something similar** that you use now?
  - What do you **like** and what do you think they could **improve**?

# Decision Paths: *Connecting User Needs with Strategy*

**Decision Paths** tell us:
- How much information a user may need at any given point to **make a decision** or **take action**.
- How much do they need to **see** or **hear** or **interact with** in order to act?
- How should all of that be **organized** and **prioritized**?

<br />


### Decision Paths & Progressive Disclosure

- **Progressive Disclosure** means:
  - Everything in the UI should progress naturally, **from simple to complex**.
  - This mimics the natural way the brain processes information, **successively**.
  - Only the **necessary** or **requested** information is displayed at any given time.

<br />

### ***PRO TIP***
The most important principle of good UI/UX is **Progressive Disclosure**.
- Information presented to someone who isn't *interested* in it - or isn't ready to *process* it - is **noise!**
