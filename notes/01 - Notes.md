*From bottom to top*

. | .
---|---
Surface | Visual UI Design
Skeleton | Navigation + Layout
Structure | Information Architecture
Scope | Requirements / Specs
Strategy | User Needs / Biz Goals

<br />
To use this model, Start with the most abstract plane (ie: Strategy) and work to the most concrete (ie: Surface then final product).

# Definition: Planning for success (pt. 1)

**5 (overview type) questions to ask before starting a project...**
1. **Why** are we doing this?
2. **Who** are we doing this for?
3. What **value** will it provide?
4. How will we **measure** success?
5. What can we **realistically** do?

<br />

## **Three Crucial Questions (YOU MUST ASK):**
1. What's **worth doing**?
2. What are we **creating**?
3. What **value** does it provide?

### **1.** What's worth doing?
- What are the tradeoffs between **importance** and **feasibility/viability**?

<br />

### **2.** What are we creating?
- Each of us has our own language and mental models.
  - Experience shapes how we label what we see, hear and interact with.
  - Those habitual, reflexive associations create mental models of what things are and how they work.
- Each stakeholder at the table will have a unique mental model.
  - The CEO may see the website like an org chart.
  - The Project manager may be thinking micro-site.
  - The Designer may be thinking rich media and interactive storytelling.
- *It is my job to get __everyone__ involved __on the same page__*
  - Lack of common understanding derails projects quickly
  - __Research__ (Questions and Answers) has to be **collaborated**, **validated**, and ***Documented***
    - YOU MUST WRITE IT DOWN
      - Lean and Agile practices require **meaningful documentation**.
      - That documentation should cover **features**, **functionality**, **platform**, and **content**.
      - Documentation does *not* have to be formal!

<br />

### **3.** What value does it provide?
*When someone visits a website **they already know what they want from it**.*

- Who's our target audience?
  - ie: 
    - African-American **pastry chef**
    - Most likely **female**
    - Anywhere from **thirty-five to forty-five** years of age

- What experiences will be valuable or compelling to them?
  - Client is in the **Blueberry** industry....
  - No way for chefs to monitor the **status of their fruit shipments** in real-time.
  - *Idea*: provide **real-time shipment tracking** via text alerts, linked to website.

- How will our offering be different from competitors?
  - B&G Blueberries has **70% of our prospective buyers**.
  - Are we **on par** with what B&G does currently? **Is the new status feature enough**?
  - Consider substitutes as well: (ie: what about the **Raspberry industry**?)

<br />

### **Section Takeaway:**
You need to know, and get EVERYONE on the same page with, three things up front:
- What's worth doing?
- What are we creating?
- What value does it provide?

<br />

## Practical Example - **Planning for a Successful Project**
- ( Online book store example )

**Determine your limits:**

- *With a client/team, sit down and write out a table like below to find the beginning of a new project*

PROBLEM/OPPORTUNITY | IMPORTANCE | FEASIBILITY
-- | -- | --
Increase unique visitors | 4 | 2
Increase purchases per visit | 5 | 4
Increase number of titles | 1 | 3
Increase number of authors | 3 | 3

<br />

**Once the table of *importance* and *feasibility* is complete, PLOT THE RESULTS**

![BookStore Example - Importance vs Feasibility](./images/01%20-%20Notes%20-%20BookStore%20Example%20-%20Importance%20vs%20Feasibility.png)

<br />

**You would then show this graph to the client/team to begin getting everyone on the same page, explain first priorities, and "nice-to-have's" vs. "Must Have's".**
