# Introduction to Requirements

## Generating Requirements

***What** needs to be designed/built?*

- *"Requirements cannot be gathered!"* - Kim Goodwin
- What users need to be able to **do** with the site
- Functionality/Content/Data
- Questions, **not Solutions**

A website's feature set is determined by **requirements**. The more features we decide to implement, the more detail we need for:
- What those features **are**
- How they should be **designed**
- What level of **coding**, **scripting**, **plugin**, or **CMS platform** is necessary to implement them.

Requirements come from **Users**:
- For existing sites: **current users**
- For a new site: a specific **target audience** who may use it

Requirements also come from **stakeholders**:
- What they believe will satisfy **customers**
- What they believe will deliver **ROI** back to their organization (from what you are building)

<br />

### **Three kinds of Requirements:**

Things people...
- say they need
- actually need
- don't know they need

<br />

- Things people **say** they need:
  - There is a huge difference between **imagining** how you'd use something and actually using it.
  - Our preferences at any given time are influenced by our **emotions**, **health**, and our **environment**.

<br />

- Things people **actually** need:
  - When we have a problem, it can be effortless to imagine a solution that will solve it. However...
    - That solution will often address a **symptom** instead of the underlying problem.
    - That symptom is the right place to start - but in needs to be **qualified** and validated.
    - Play it forward to uncover the **other actions, processes** and **motivations** attached to the problem.
  - Do we fully understand **every step in every task flow** from the standpoint of both the user and every other user role?
  - Do we have any evidence that tells us this feature or function would solve a **frequent** or **recurring** problem?
  - Is there **research** we can perform? Are there specific scenarios or tasks where **user observation** would help to fill in the blanks?

<br />

- Things people **don't know** they need:
  - *"People don't want quarter inch drills, they want quarter inch holes!"* - Ted Lovett
  - The **desired outcome** is more important than the chosen tool.
  - Conversations about **expected outcomes** - instead of features, functions and content - produce more relevant requirements for *features, functions, and content!*
  - When Problems arise, we look for **convenience** first, which will almost always **trump** best practice.
  - **Instead of talking about the website or its features or functions, focus on:**
    - The **problem** people are facing
    - What the **desired outcome** is
    - What they're most likely to **do** to solve it - with or without your website!

## Documenting Requirements

- Whatever requirements you create, you **need to document them**.
- There is a common misunderstanding that following a **Lean or Agile methodology** means no documentation of any kind
  - This is obviously not true
  - It means **less** documentation - not no documentation.

**Documentation eliminates excuses**
- If decisions are documented and shared, **anyone** at any time can pull up that document and get educated on the project.
- You don't have to write a novel; just **capture it** somewhere, somehow.
- Make sure every person involved has **access** to it.
- As requirements are **approved**, that approval is noted as well (in the documents available to **everyone**)

## Determining Project Scope

*When it come to interacting with clients, partners or fellow team members: **Silence Equals Agreement.***

<br />

### Controlling Scope Creep

*During the initial stages of any project, you can bet on two things happening:*
  - Everybody and their brother will have ideas about features.
  - There will be a significant number of questions surrounding content, features, and functions

<br />

#### **1. Document assumptions for anything you don't know**

- **example:** (What you would put in the documents to assume authentication will not be handled by my team.)

*"The scope of work and estimated cost assumes that we will not integrate data or facilitate the exchange of secure data from the website to the reporting system.*
    
We will provide a direct link on the home page of the website which will take the user to the login screen of the reporting system, where they will enter their login credentials.*

*Any functionality beyond this will be estimated separately."*

- You just described what you are agreeing to do very clearly, and you are stating that **anything outside this will take more time and cost more money**.
- You are also helping the client in pointing out that **this is a topic that needs to be discussed further** if it matters to them.
- **For every similar instance, you add an assumption.** Until you have a page containing a *list* of assumptions for your proposal and contract for services.

<br />

#### **2. Document what you're doing right now**
While this is the time for idea generation and brainstorming, it's also important to draw a clear line between **what's doable right now** versus what has to wait for later.
- Every additional feature requires **time, budget,** and **talent** - which you may or may not have.
- "Anything can be done." - The question is **how long will it take to do it**?
- When you don't know the answer to that question, you keep a **running list** that you have to pay attention to.

## *If you're doing it without the list, **You're guessing!** Write it down.*
