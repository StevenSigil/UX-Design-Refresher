## Defining Appropriate User Interface Design

The most inportant role of the UI is to **encourage** the visitor to find out what's beyond that first screen.

Appropriate UI Design enables visitors to do **what they came to do**

In order for your UI Design to be appropriate, three things have to happen:

- It cannot be **generic**
- It has to be informed by the **type of audience** who will use the website
- It should represent your (or the clients) **brand identity**

<br />

### **1. Defy the Generic**

*If no one hates your website, **no one loves it either***

- Generic UI Design is **easy**, **but** it's **unmemorable**

- **Questions your conventions:**

  - Is your background always **white**?
  - Do you always use **horizontal navigation**?
  - DO you always use an **image carousel** on the homepage?
  - Do you **sacrifice navigation cues for content** in the name of _"flat design"_?

  ### A widespread style trend is not proof that it's the best or most intuitive idea for your UI. **It means most people imitate instead of innovate**.

<br />

### **2. Audience First**

**_Trying to be everything to everybody rarely works_**

- The **form and function** of the Web depends entirely on who it's for:
  - Users
  - Viewers
  - Readers

### Users

- **Clear navigation and text**
  - Plainly marked and easily understood elements
- **Users have no patience for digression**
- **Users expect sites to load quickly**

### Viewers

- **Viewers want to be surprised, seduced, led along a path.**
  - Their goal is the journey - not the end result
- **Animation, motion, and video** are both desired and expected
- **Even when the subject is business, the audience may be made up of viewers.**
  - ie: https://blacknegative.com/

### Readers

- Readers turn to a web site as they might turn to a novel or magazine article
  - They expect and want to invest time.
- Visual cues in the UI should signal ROI
  - ie: https://Medium.com/
- Blogs are for readers
  - Lots of negative space, large fonts, frequent paragraph and page breaks to ease eye strain

<br />

### **3. Brand Matters...**

- Anyone can have a website, but not everyone has a _Brand_
- **Your UI has to be as uniquely you as it can be**
  - in content, presentation, and navigation.
- **If you can replace the logo on your site with someone elses** - your UI design is generic
- **Building a unique, memorable, visual brand identity is one way smaller organizations get larger** (and how the larger ones stay on top).
- Your website - in form, content and function - must **communicate your brand identity**
  - What does the person, product or service do that makes it so **different**?
  - What has this organization done lately that makes it **stand out**?
  - What is your **greatest** and **clearest strength**?
  - _Why should anyone **care**?_

## How Definition and IA Inform UI Design

### **Revisit your strategy**

- The things users expect and the value of what's there has to made visibly evident in the UI:
  - What **calls to action** are most important?
  - What does a visitor need to **see** or **experience** that will **compel them to act**?
  - How does that evidence need to be **designed** in order to be **compelling**?
  - How will the UI separate **primary and secondary content** and action?

<br />

### **Information Architecture == Information Priority**

You established information priority and key navigation paths in your IA. Both things have to manifest in your UI to create the **UX Value Loop**

- **First, the user has to perceive value**
  - What do they need to see, scan and read in the first 3.5 seconds to get that message?
- **Next, they have to get proof of that value from their first click, tap or swipe.**
  - What they see, scan or read has to support the promise made on the previous screen

<br />

***If they get value, they'll act again***
- When THat trust occurs, they sign up or support or share or purchase
- When that happens, value comes back to the organization, the site's creator.
    - Money made/saved, membership or market share increased, political agenda more widely shared and distributed, etc...

*Every UI Decision you make should provide **Visible Evidence of Value***
