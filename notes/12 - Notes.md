# Designing Appropriate Visual Hierarchy

Where does the eye go first? Next? *Why*?
- What elements of the design draws the user's attention first?
- Is the first object of attention a distraction from their goals?
- Is what they're drawn to first strategically important to them? To you or your Client?
- What visual elements are constraining or directing the user's focus?
- To what degree does color, contrast and visual form (shapes) influence this focus?

<br />

## Visual Paths: Following the Eye

- The eye moves in a smooth flow.
- When someone says your design is "busy", what they're saying is that the design **doesn't lead them around the screen**.
- A good UI gives a guided tour of what's available, without overwhelming the user with detail.
- Available choices support the person's **expectations, goals,** and **intended task**.

<br />

### **The Z-Pattern**

- **The top line contains items you want the user to see first**
- **The next two fixation points tell the story** - Why this matters, why it's valuable, what you can *do* here
- **All roads lead to the call to action** - What you want the user to do (or they expect to do) first
    
    <br />

    ![12 - Notes - ZPattern](./images/12%20-%20Notes%20-%20ZPattern.png)

- Works best with minimal content and clear call-to-action (ie: "Sign up now")
- Does not work well with more complex information structures
- Great for entry screens or product tours

<br />

### **The F-Pattern**

- Visitors start at the **top left**
- They **Scan the top or header area** (navigation, search, etc)
- They move down, reading the **next full row of content**, toward the right sidebar
- Once they hit the bulk of content, they begin a **scanning pattern**
    - ie: they continue moving from the spine of the "F" to the right with less importance placed on a structured design

    <br />

    </blockquote>
<br />

- Evident behavior patterns:
    - **Identity** and wayfinding are first
    - Sidebar content is **dismissed** 'below the fold'
    - Attention is focused on the **main content column**
    - **Images** receive the most attention
    - **Headlines** are next
    - **Text is Scanned** - not read

**Caveats on eye tracking studies:**
- They're not totally accurate
- They record and display **foveal fixations**, the small part of our visual field that produces the sharpest vision
- They **don't record peripheral vision**
- **We can see things without fixating on them** - These studies don't represent *everything* someone would see

    ### **Eye tracking studies are not gospel.** They don't account for 98% of what is being seen.

## **Differences: Directing Focus**

- The brain uses differences to **make sense** of your environment
- Your brain is continuously directing your eyes to look for **boundaries**
- The **strength** of that perception is dependent on multiple factors.
    - **Color** 
    - **Contrast**
    - **Shape**

<br />

### **Color perception** is eneabled by three types of **Contrast:**
- **Value Contrast**
    - Varying the lightness and darkness of a color
- **Saturation Contrast**
    - Varying the saturation (chroma) of a color
- **Hue Contrast**
    - Using different colors (hues) that are easy to tell apart

<br />

### Color and contrast often depend on **context**
- The entire experience is strictly contextual - there's only **one reason** for you to be here...
- If there is only one reason for you to be here, ther can be only **one call-to-action**
    - ie: **Send** button on email applications
- Color & Contrast clearly indication **what** that call-to-action is - and where it's **located**

    ### **Color and Contrast Depend on Context** - Design so all three reinforce each other.

<br />

### How can we tell if color contrast is **appropriate**?
- Take a screenshot and grey-scale it (in photoshop)
    - See how well the contrast separates elements/text on the screen

# Designing for Audience Expectation

## Expectations are first formed visually

At a glance, the brain is processing possible answers to these questions:

- What **does this do**?
- How **well** does it do that?
- How **hard** is this to use?
- What's it going to **cost** me?

    ### We **DO** judge products by their appearance!

### **Expectations are first formed visually!** - The first impression will make or break you

<br />

The very first visual exposure has to:

- Rapidly establish the **value proposition** in the viewer's mind
- Lead them toward **continuing the experience** (furthering the relationship)
- Introduce new information and enable action at the most **relevant**, most **appropriate** points in the experience

<br />

### **Value is expected to be obvious and sustained**

Every visual element has to:

- **Match the person's prediction** as to what they expect to happen
- Add **immediate value**
- Add **positively** to the **cumulative experience** over time
- **Deliver proof** that the person is moving closer to achieving their goal

    ### **Technology changes. People don't.** Your UI must answer *First Use** questions (above)

### The usefulness of onscreen elements **decreases** when their number increases

- Choices about what to include should be based on the **cognitive abilities and limitations** of the people who have to *decode* those elements

### The more brainpower your visitor uses to decode your website, the less they have for **understanding** it!

- Show what matters most **first**
- Communicate that **more** is available
- **Point the way** to get to it all

    ### The most important principle of good UI/UX is **Progressive Disclosure** - Information presented to someone who isn't *interested* in it - or isn't ready to *process* it - is **noise**

# Design for Interaction - *IxD*

## Five Core Principles of Interaction Design

1. Consistency
2. Visibility
3. Learnability
4. Predictability
5. Feedback

<br />

---

<br />

## IxD must be **Consistent**

- Be different when it makes things **better**
- When visitors start asking why something is the way it is, they're focused on the interface and **not on the content**
- Differences can draw attention, but they can also cause **distraction**
- Components with **similar behavior** should have a **similar appearance**
- Components with **different behavior** should have a **different appearance**

<br />

### Sloppy design is distracting - and inattention to detail reduces credibility and trust.

- **Color and Pattern:** image optimization and color shifts
- **Size**, proportions, rotation, scaling and skewing
- **Shape**: rounded corners, glows, and shadows

<br />

### Consistency is expressed most by interactive **behavior** and **voice** associated with text and images

- **Behavior**
    - Once you introduce an interaction behavior, never change it.
        - ie: Transitions, rollovers, tooltips, etc... All should be consistent on all screens (pages)
    - Use established UI conventions when appropriate
        - Leverage teh visitor's prior experience with other websites to make your site easier to use.
- **Voice**
    - Labels and terms should be teh same throughout
        - Different labels mean different information - and suggest different *outcomes*
    - Content and imagery should be consistent as well
        - ie: photos, illustrations, etc... should all have a stable, consistent style (same *look*)

<br />

### Design patterns create consistency as well:
- Content may change, but **interaction** and **process** stays the same
- **Actions** and **results** are made consistent (and predictable)

<br />

---

<br />

## IxD must be **Visible**

*Make it obvious that more content is only a scroll away*

- **Discoverablity** should NOT involve luck or chance
    - People should be able to tell that an **opportunity to interact** is available
    - Use **Content Hinting**
        - Avoid **false bottoms** when more content and interactivity exists below the fold or beyond the visible space

- Different text color, 3D, and icons **invite interaction**
    - **Do not disappoint the viewer when they try to interact with it**

### Touch and Gesture also post interesting challenges

- There is **no hover state** for touch screens
- Consider the lefties of the world by making an interface **reversible**
- Don't make people reach over the interface and **obstruct their view

<br />

---

<br />

## IxD must be **Learnable**

- Interactions should be easy to **learn** and **remember**
    - Use it once, learn it quickly, remember it forever
- **Intuitive** really means **_single-trial learning_**
- Even interfaces that are easy still require **learning**
    - The more we use something, **the easier it seems**
- Actions have to be obvious and **expected**

<br />

---

<br />

## IxD must be **Predictable**

- **Passing the "Trunk Test"** - Steve Krug, *Don't Make Me Think*
    - ie: You're blindfolded, thrown in the trunk of a car, and driven around the city for an hour. Then you're dumped out in some random part of the city. Based on what you see around you, can you answer these four questions?
        - Where am I?
        - How did I get here?
        - What can I do here?
        - Where can I go from here?

<br />

- Use **previews** to set user expectations for new or complex interactions
    - ie: Show what can be done **while the interface loads**
    - ie: SHow a high-level view of the **structure** to provide context (map or overlay)

<br />

- Labels, instructions, icons, and images can all be used to set expectations about:
    - What to do *(touch here!)*
    - What will **happen** 
    - Where the visitor is and can go
    - How the screen will respond

<br />

---

<br />

## IxD must **Provide Feedback**

- Feedback Provides:
    - **Location** - where am I?
    - **Status** - What's happening? is still happening?
    - **Future State** - What will happen?
    - **Outcomes / Results** - This just happened

- Every action should produce a **visible, uderstandable** and **immediate reaction**
    - **Acknowledge Interactions** - Let people know they have been heard or acknowledged
    - Failing to acknowledge an interaction can lead to **unnecessary repetition** of actions and **errors** - which results in mistakes
        - ie: Purchasing a product multiple times because the *Buy Now* button seemed to do nothing (no confirmation)

<br />

### The best way to handle errors it to **prvent them**
- **Describe what** happened
- **Explain why** it happened
- **Suggest** a **fix**
- **NEVER BLAME THE PERSON (user)**

<br />

<br />

## These Principles are **Interrelated**

- **Consistency** help people use what they know
- **Visibility** of opportunity can invite interaction
- **Learning** is easer when **Predictions** are accurate
- **Feedback** facilitates learning
