## **Navigation** - Primary and Secondary Navigation

- Primary Navigation 
    - Content that most users are interested in
    - The things they came here for

- Secondary Navigation 
    - Content that doesn't serve the primary goal of the website, but is still of interest to the user.

- NOTE: **importance is relative** to each user visiting your website
     - Importance changes according to what people need most

## **Navigation** - Global and Local Navigation

- Global Navigation
    - Appears on every page of a website
    - Allows users to switch between top-level categories from **any location**
    - Ensures a user can get a sense of what's available on the website

- Local Navigation
    - Only appears on category pages and is specific to that particular category
    - It helps users preview lower level content in the context of a category
    - Minimizes cognitive load by only showing items related to the current choice

## **Navigation** - For Different User Types

- *Content can change depending on things like "if is logged in"*

- **Tips for having different user types**
    - Know how many user levels exist
    - Design and plan for each level separately
    - Detail content differences for users (ie: if a visitor needs convincing to join)
    - Focus on context of use (ie: What does the user want to accomplish in the context of membership?)

## **Navigation** - Validating your Navigation Scheme

- **Consider how strong *information scent* is at any given point of the user's journey**
    - How much useful information you are likely to find on any given path based on a first interaction with the navigation scheme (navbar)

- **Passing the *Trunk Test*** (Steve Krug, *Don't Make Me Think*)
    - ie: You're blindfolded, thrown in the trunk of a car, and driven around the city for an hour. Then you're dumped out in some random part of the city. Based on what you see around you, can you answer these four questions?
        - Where am I?
        - How did I get here?
        - What can I do here?
        - Where can I go from here?
    
    - If you (your user) can answer all four questions correctly, your navigation...
        - Provides a strong sense of place
        - Sets the correct expectations
        - Allows users to accurately predict the outcome of interactions
    - If you get "I don't know" to any of those questions: you have a navigation problem

## **Exercise** - Determining Key Navigation Paths

1. Identify Valuable Outcomes
    - What's the value proposition?
        - Why should I sign up (or access specific information)?
    - What do users want to happen, and what do you want to happen?
        - What outcomes deliver the most value to both the user and business
    - How many valuable outcomes exist, and how important is each?
        - If a user only follows one, which should it be?

2. Identify direct paths to value
    - Is the path to that value obvious?
        - From the home page, can a user immediately see the path that gets them to their goal in the fastest manner?
    - Does that path also answer questions?
        - ie: "How do I..." questions

    ### *Make the path(s) to value **Obvious and Clear** in your navigation*

    - Draw out the *assumed navigation paths* then identify (colored) the most valuable navigation paths a user would be likely to take
        - ie: setting the groundwork to get rid (move) unnecessary paths

3. Expose those Paths in UI Design
    - Cut down the paths to make the most amount of users find the navigation valuable
